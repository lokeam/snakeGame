The following repo represents 180 minutes of work. I ran out of time before I could implement the following:

- Game Over screen
- High Score screen
- Settings screen
- Score counter on Heads up display
- Timer on Heads up display
- Death counter on Heads up display
- Game mechanic where snake moves faster with each mouse eaten
- Sound effects and additional visual effects on both mouse eaten and death events
- Refactor game loop and optimize animations for faster performance
- Refactor fonts and canvas paiting to allow for more detailed, multi-layered, multi colored custom font effects in title screen
- Implement pixel-art game sprites and a detailed tiled background
- Additional levels and obstacles in game field
- Mobile and legacy browser support
- More thorough separation of files and roles in accordance with common game dev coding standards
